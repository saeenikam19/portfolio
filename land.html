          about shoes
        </h4>
        <p>Men's and women's shoes are designed with different considerations in mind, primarily focusing on fit,
             support, and style. Men's shoes often feature wider widths, thicker materials, and more durable soles to accommodate 
             broaders feet and support heavier body weight. Women's shoes, on the other hand, tend to be narrower, lighter, 
            and more flexible, often with extra padding in the arch for enhanced comfort.</p>
